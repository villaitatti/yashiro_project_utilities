<p>Settignano. Apr. 6. 57</p><p>My dear Yashiro,</p><p align="left">I am distressed to hear of your illness, and unhappy that your plans, and the prospect of having you here soon have to be postponed.</p><p align="left">Please keep me informed if only with post-card.</p><p align="left">Thanks for the photo of yourself and of your so fascinating wife.</p><p align="left">I myself am still too feeble to begin working again, and I am bored by the enforced leisure.</p><p align="left">I gave a word of introduction to you for my cousin, <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Berenson-Robert" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Berenson-Robert">Robert Berenson</a>, who is on some U.S.A. mission to the Far East. If without trouble, without the least worry you can help him I should be grateful. But please, do not put yourself out.</p><p align="left">With my best to you both.</p><p>Affectionately,</p><p><em>B.B.</em></p>
