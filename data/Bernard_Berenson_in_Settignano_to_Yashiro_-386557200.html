<p>Settignano. Oct. 2. 57</p><p>My dear Yashiro, </p><p align="left">I am deeply distressed to know that you were still in hospital, and feeling so weak and ill. It is heartrending. All my sympathy with you and your beloved wife! Nor am I a sample of health. Only at 92 I have no right to complain, while you comparatively are still so young. We are sending off <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Maraini-Fosco" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Maraini-Fosco">Fosco Maraini’s</a> book on Japan. It is rather encyclopedic and rag-baggy, but contains wonderfully interesting personal material as well. I am sure it will interest you.</p><p align="left">Delighted with the prospect of seeing myself in Japanese translation. If a success in Japan, other things that might interest your public, for instance my Sketch for a Self-Portrait, and my little books on Piero della Francesca and Caravaggio. </p><p align="left">Ever affectionately and devotedly…and your wife,</p><p align="left"><em>B.B.</em></p>
