<p><span>Dec. 29, 1933</span></p>
<p>Dear Yashiro,</p>
<p>Thanks for your pretty Xmas card and all its good wishes which we reciprocate heartily. I wish 1934 would bring us together again, and let me enjoy your company and profit by all that you have learned of Far Eastern art since I last saw you.</p>
<p>The revision of my Florence Drawings is advancing. Presently<strong>Â </strong>I shall only have Michelangelo and his immediate followers to do.</p>
<p>I will send soon a long article on the debatable ground, as it were, between Verrocchio Leonardo and Credi. If you ever see Prof. <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Anesaki-Masaharu" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Anesaki-Masaharu">Anesaki </a>remember to him and tell him it would give me real joy to meet with him again.</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p><em>B. Berenson</em></p>
