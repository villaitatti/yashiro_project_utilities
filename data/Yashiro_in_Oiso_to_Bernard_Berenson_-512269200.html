<p align="left">1017 Oiso, Japan<br/>Oct 8<sup>th </sup></p><p align="left">Dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">I should have written to you long ago, but as I told you before, I fell ill soon after my return to Japan from U.S. &amp; have not recovered yet. The high blood pressure is very difficult to cure &amp; I am still keeping quiet. Any mental exertion I have to refrain from as much as I can &amp; that is the reason why I have not written to you so long. But fortunately I am recovering little by little.</p><p align="left">Meanwhile my pupil <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu">Mr. Fukumatsu Miwa</a> went to Italy &amp; now he must be in Rome. Italian government began to give fellowship for Italian studies to Japanese students &amp; I recommended Miwa [&amp;] he was successful to get it. Miwa is not so terribly brilliant as a scholar, but he is serious in his studies. As he seems to have corresponded with you about his translation of your book on Self portrait, &amp; you know him, I did not give him my card of introduction. But I have encouraged him to call on you. His stay in Italy is altogether one year &amp; I do not [know] how long he can stay in Florence. While he is there please allow him to make use of your library &amp; photographs.</p><p align="left">About the translation of your Italian Painters, it is going on, but very slowly, which seems to be irritating to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">Horovitz</a> &amp; to me too. The case is Japanese government insists to put income tax on the printed plates to be sent by, Horovitz &amp; our publisher is now negotiating with our tax office. I think it would be decided anyway in a future not very far, so please do have a little patience &amp; wait. After the tax question is over, anything will go on pretty quickly, because I have decided on most reliable translators.</p><p align="left">Your ever faithful pupil,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p><p align="left">Please give my love to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky Mariano</a>.</p>
