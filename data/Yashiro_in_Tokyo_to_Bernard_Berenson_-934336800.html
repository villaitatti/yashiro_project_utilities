I am always keeping in very inmost heart your desire and my promise to you, that I shall apply what method of study I have learned from you in my Italian studies by your side to the study of Eastern Arts. My institute, which I have established with that idea and which our government was kind enough to take its own, financed by the national budget, is already more than ten years old &amp; its importance is now generally recognized. Thinking of that, I feel very happy &amp; I am still striving how to clear the Eastern art histories of all “pre-<a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Morelli-Giovanni" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Morelli-Giovanni">Morellian</a> nonesenses”, so to speak &amp; to establish them on sounder basis, just as you have done with the Italian art history. Can I not ask you a special favour of giving me a photo of you. I really want a portrait of you in my room, so that I can always look at my teacher at any time &amp; remember his teachings.</p><p align="left">Thank you very much for your subscription to the Society of Friends of Eastern Art.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yuki</em></p><p align="left">Please remember me to Mrs. Berenson &amp; to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Miss Nicky Mariano</a>.</p>
