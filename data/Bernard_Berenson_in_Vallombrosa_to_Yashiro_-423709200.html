If you find an hour of leisure, do write and tell me what you have been doing in all the places you have been to.</p><p align="left">If you seeÂ <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto">Auriti</a>, remember me to him, and ask him to let me know when the Persian show closes. If after Sept. 15 I should come to see it, and Auriti as well.</p><p align="left">My best to you and your dear wife,</p>
