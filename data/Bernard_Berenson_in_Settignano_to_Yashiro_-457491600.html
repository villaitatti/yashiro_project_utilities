<p>Settignano. July 4. 55</p>
<p>My dear Yashiro,</p>
<p>Thanks for Etudes sur les Problems Sti [Stylistiques?]. I fear you have gone to great expense of time and money to procure it. I am sending you a bibliography that has just appeared of my publications.</p>
<p>In no distant future I hope to send the English version of “Lorenzo Lotto,” the first part of the catalogue of Italian Painting, and some smaller things.</p>
<p>Do go on with your book on Far Eastern Art. I am sure you will find a publisher.</p>
<p>Affectionately,</p>
<p><em>B.B.</em></p>
