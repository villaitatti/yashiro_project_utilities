This is just a short note, a preliminary one, to let you know how grateful we are and I will write again as soon as your book reaches us.

I have claimed for another one and it should be here in a few days. – B.B. is a little better than last summer and at any rate free from pain, but very frail and helpless and exhausted by the* effort*.  He is very silent and withdrawn … good deal of the *. Now and then he has better and lovelier days and is able to communicate with the outer world without any difficulty.</p><p align="left">He sends you and Fumi his love and so do I.</p><p align="left">Ever yours,</p><p align="left"><em>Nicky</em></p><p align="left">* uncertain reading</p>
