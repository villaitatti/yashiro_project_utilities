<p align="left">Oiso, Oct. 31<sup>st</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">How are you getting on? Now under the blue sky of autumn you must be enjoying one of the best seasons in the year. I do hope you are well!</p><p align="left">About a month ago your friends the <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Wrightsman-Charles" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Wrightsman-Charles">Wrightsmans</a> arrived in Japan with your letter of introduction. Indeed they are extremely nice people, &amp; we liked them very very much. Their stay in Japan was very short, so I could not meet them so often as we could hope, but I tried hard to let them see some of the best examples of Japanese art, which are not usually shown to visitors. Both myself &amp; my wife <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumi</a> &amp; our son <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/akio-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/akio-yashiro">Akio</a> are all very glad to have come to know them. We promised to call on them, when we go to America.</p><p align="left">Some days ago we met other friends of yours <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Gui-Vittorio" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Gui-Vittorio">Maestro Vittorio Gui</a> &amp; his wife, who came to Japan to present Italian operas, which were a great success. Our son Akio as a composer knew Gui’s works &amp; his fame &amp; it was Akio, who first met them after a concert &amp; they told him that they know me &amp; my wife well through their conversations with BB, etc. etc. We were only too glad to meet Guis themselves after a few days. There was no end to our talks to each other. Their talks about their home at Fiesole, about you, about <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a> &amp; about many other persons &amp; things in Florence made me really homesick for Florence. I wonder, when I can visit Florence again &amp; come to I Tatti to greet you again personally.</p><p align="left">There is one possibility of my visit to I Tatti again in a future not very far. The English publishers the Medici of my “Botticelli” are willing to republish it in a revised edition, and I want to do it very much. Because although my old book on Botticelli is unsatisfactory in many ways, I feel a sentimental attachment to it, and I want to republish it in a renewed form. In order to do it, I have to study Botticelli over again, so that I may make the new edition up-to-date. For this purpose the best place for my work is of course I Tatti, where I shall have to study in the library perhaps for three months, and then I want to travel some places in Europe &amp; America to see Botticellis &amp; to collect good photographs. If this scheme of the revised edition of Botticelli materializes, I shall have the pleasure of staying sometime in Florence again &amp; frequenting I Tatti, as I used to do more than thirty years ago. I do hope such time comes again soon, so that I can meet you as much as I can and get your last teachings as much as possible.</p><p align="left">At present I am busily writing in English a book or rather the introductory text for an Album “Masterpieces of Japanese Art,” which would be published by the English publishers Thames &amp; Hudson in London next year. As I have to finish the text in haste, I do not think that it would make a good book, but as an album it will surely be very beautiful, because I shall use very good photos made by a special German photographer, who was sent to Japan by my publisher.</p><p align="left">I think I have already told you that I am being invited by Stanford University, California to come as Consultant Professor for a period. Although it is not yet definite, yet I can say I shall perhaps go there in December &amp; stay there for about five months. If I go there at all, I shall surely visit <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">John Walker</a> at Washington &amp; talk over the projects of my books with him.</p><p align="left">I hope this letter will find you well and healthy. I wanted to tell you how we met the Wrightsmans and the Guis &amp; how we were glad to have met them.</p><p align="left">There are many other things to tell you, but I think it wiser to stop here &amp; post this letter, so that it arrives you earlier, although as a letter it is still very inadequate.</p><p align="left">My wife Fumi sends her love to you &amp; to Nicky.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
