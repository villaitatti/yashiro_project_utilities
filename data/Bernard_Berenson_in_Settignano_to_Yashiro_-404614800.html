<p>I Tatti<br/>Settignano<br/>Florence<br/>March 7, 1957</p><p align="left">My dear Yashiro,</p><p align="left">I am distressed to read in your note of the 3rd what you have been through, what you are threatened with and what you are going through. I need not tell you how fervently I pray that every trace of malignancy may disappear from you system.</p><p align="left">Of course it is very hard on you to have to put off your visit to Stanford University. I have no doubt that they will be no less happy to have you when you are well enough to go there and may this be soon.</p><p align="left">I need not tell you how happy I shall be to see you again and of course put the library at your entire disposal.</p><p align="left">As for myself, I regret to tell you that I have been alarmingly ill and am much better but only weaker and feebler. It will take some time before I am at all myself again. Then there is the incurable trouble that I am so near to being 92 years old.</p><p align="left">A cousin of mine, <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Berenson-Robert" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Berenson-Robert">Robert Berenson</a>, with his wife will be travelling on U.S. Government business and perhaps reach Japan before you leave. In that case, will you be an angel and help him out in every way you can to see what he ought to see, scenery, works of art and people?</p><p align="left">With my respectful regards to your wife and heartiest wishes for your speedy recovery,</p><p>Affectionately,</p><p><em>B.B.</em></p>
