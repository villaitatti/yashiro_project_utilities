<p>Dear B.B.</p>
<p>Betraying my promise, my extremely busy trip through China did not allow me to write you letters. The trip was extremely interesting, but it was hard, &amp; I came back to Tokyo thoroughly exhausted after more than two months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your last letter arrived which I was so glad to read. Your picture was framed during my absence &amp; it now hangs in my room, giving me nice memories of my study with you at I Tatti. Looking at it I feel how I am attached to you.</p>
<p>Herewith under separate cover I send you a photo of my family. They all know you very well through your photograph &amp; through my talks about you and I Tatti. My wife <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumiko</a> is 33 years, my boy 10, my girl 7, &amp; myself 50!! You would be astonished to hear that I am nearly a sage of 50 years. My boy is a funny little boy. By nature he has the absolute pitch of the ear in a most perfect way &amp; is considered a musical prodigy. He began to compose from when he was 5 years old. There is no other way for me except giving him a good musical education &amp; making him up into a musician. I wish I could take him to Europe &amp; give him chances for good study. He plays piano beautifully.</p>
<p><a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/itsuji-yoshikawa" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/itsuji-yoshikawa">Mr. Itsuji Yoshikawa</a>, who published his iconographical study of St. Savin frescoes, is really my own pupil. He is a brilliant young scholar &amp; he has been studying at the Sorbonne under Prof. Focillon. Now he is back in Japan &amp; is working in my Institute. For his studies for the future staying in Japan, I am thinking how I can put on the right way of art-studies.</p>
<p>Under separate cover I send you a copy of my lecture at the Royal Society in London. As I cannot exactly grasp what part in the lecture you wanted me to copy, I send you the whole thing.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
