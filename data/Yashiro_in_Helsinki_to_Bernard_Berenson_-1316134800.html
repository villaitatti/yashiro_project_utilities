<p>[letterhead: Hotel Societetshuset/ Helsingfors]<br/>18 April 1928</p>
<p>Dear Mr. B. Berenson,</p>
<p>This is to say goodbye to you before my final departure for the East. I take train for Leningrad to-night, thence towards Moscow, Manchuria, Korea &amp; Japan.</p>
<p>I recollect with pleasure the nice afternoon I spent at I Tatti in February. I shall ever retain the advices you gave me there. My “Institute of Art Research” is eagerly waiting for me. The building is nearly finished. You will hear by &amp; by of my activity in the field of Oriental art with what training I have had, studying European Art under your influence.</p>
<p>Please tell Mrs. Berenson that I am very sorry being unable to meet her at Florence &amp; that I sincerely wish for her quick recovery. Please tell Miss Mariano that she can write to me at any time for whatever thing I can do from my distant country. I have decided to prove myself a better correspondent from now!</p>
<p>Good-bye &amp; all my best wishes to you,</p>
<p>Yours most sincerely,</p>
<p><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
