<p align="left">Oiso, Aug 5<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">This is an exceptionally hot summer, &amp; we are just breathing &amp; doing nothing under this terrible heat! I sincerely wish that you are well and happy.</p><p align="left">Thank you very much for your letter of July 4<sup>th</sup>, telling me that you are sending me a Bibliography of your publication &amp; other books (“English Version of Lorenzo Lotto” &amp; others, when they come out). Your ever kind consideration of me moves me very deeply. I thank you very much in advance.</p><p align="left">Sometime ago Nicky wrote to me, and asked me if “Pageant of Japanese Art”, published by Toto Bunka Co. four volumes, are worth having for I Tatti Library. I know the book only in Japanese version, which is in 6 vols. The text is commonplace, the illustrations are pretty good, although there are too many plates of details from well-known masterpieces. One of these days I will visit the publisher &amp; see, if the edition for abroad in four volumes are as good as the edition for the home-land &amp; then I shall decide, whether I shall get it for BB’s library.</p><p align="left">I am very sorry to say that the Japanese edition of the Italian Painters is still very much delayed. One of the translators, the most active one, had gone to U.S. with Fulbright fellowship &amp; his absence from Japan was a great impediment to the progress of the translation &amp; publication. He is coming back to Japan in about a week &amp; then we shall all go to the work in earnest.</p><p align="left"><a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Coolidge-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Coolidge-John">John Coolidge</a>, who was with you a little time ago, wrote to me about you. His description of you &amp; of I Tatti carried me away to Settignano in imagination. How I want to call on you again at that villa, which my spiritual native place.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em> Yuki</em></p><p align="left">(Please remember me to Nicky)</p>
