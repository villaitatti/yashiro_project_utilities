<p>Settignano, Oct. 22. 53 </p><p>My dear Yashiro,</p><p>I regret to learn that you have been so ill, and that you are mending so slowly.</p><p align="left">Please do not add to your burden the translation of my Italian Painters. I am not at all in a hurry, altho’ it would please me to know that I was being read in Japan.</p><p align="left">Of course I shall let <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu">Miwa</a> use my library.</p><p align="left">We are busy now planning a new edition of Italian Painters which <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">Horovitz</a> will publish. It will be in four volumes, each with 800 reproductions of “key pictures.” The first will contain the Venetian Pictures. And a new edition of “Lorenzo Lotto” is going to the press, and you will receive a copy. I wish I had the energy I once had, because there is so much I want to do and could do. </p><p>Affectionately,</p><p><em>B.B.</em></p>
