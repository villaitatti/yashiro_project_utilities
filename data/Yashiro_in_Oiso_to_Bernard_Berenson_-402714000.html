<p>Oiso, 29 March</p>
<p>My dear B.B.,</p>
<p>We are frightened to hear that you were not well. But we feel relieved knowing that now you are better.</p>
<p>I myself has not been well. By this time I ought to be at Stanford University California, but the medical examination before leaving Japan brought out some unknown illness to light, &amp; I was put in Cancer hospital for about a month &amp; I was treated with Ray Cobalt 60. This treatment is not painful at all, but very very exhausting &amp; even now I have not recovered from the fatigue. After some interval I have to get the Ray treatment again, &amp; so for the moment I have to give up my plan to go to America for some time. I am always talking with my wife how we wish to visit you again at I Tatti.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
