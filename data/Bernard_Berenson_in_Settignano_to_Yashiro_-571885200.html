<p>Nov. 18. 51<br/>I Tatti<br/>Settignano<br/>Florence</p>
<p>Dear Yashiro, </p>
<p>Delighted to hear that at last you are in Europe, and I look forward to seeing you here. You must use I Tatti as you would your home. Come and stay as long as it suits you. There are plenty of buses going to town, and besides, our car goes there often.</p>
<p>I am sure you will find material in our library that will<strong> </strong>interest you. </p>
<p>Two days ago I had a letter from <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu">Mr. Miwa</a> saying he had nearly completed translating my “Sketch for a Self Portrait.” I wonder what the result will be in Japanese, assuming that the translator understands English well enough!</p>
<p>Let me hear from you again and again, and finally the day and the hour of your arrival in Florence so that I may send the car for you. </p>
<p>Remember me to your host.</p>
<p>Affectionately,</p>
<p><em>B.B.</em></p>
