<p>Dear Mr &amp; Mrs. Berenson,</p>
<p>Time passes so quickly. I am entirely lost in my work. I can find no time to write letters, even to you. When I feel myself a little freer, the first thing I would do is to write to you, to write you all the nonsenses I felt &amp; am feeling since I left Florence and you.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sent by parcel post some Dante photos from the Vatican. The detail ones are of the original size. The detail from the Chant of Hell is very well done. I hope you will like it.</p>
<p>The N. G. [National Gallery] photos I will send to you as soon as they are done. If there is any other thing I can do for you in London, do let me.</p>
<p>This is a dry &amp; short letter, hardly compatible with the warm attachment I feel for you. But I must begin my work now. Au revoir -- but when?</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p><em>Yuki Yashiro</em></p>
