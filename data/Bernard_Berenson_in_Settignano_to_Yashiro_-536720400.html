<p>Settignano, Dec. 29. ’52</p><p>Dear Yashiro,</p><p>Thank you for yours of the 21<sup>st</sup>. I await eagerly the return of the scroll, and your Japanese article on it, as well as your Roman lecture.</p><p>Thank you for all you say about translating my Italian Painters. I shall forward what you tell me to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">Horovitz</a>, the Phaidon publisher, and ask him to communicate with you directly.</p><p>I am addressing you a booklet on the reliefs of the Arch of Constantine, in which I apply our methods of handling an art subject, empirically instead of ideologically.</p><p>I hope now to take up the preparation of the new “Lorenzo Lotto.”</p><p>Then I shall be free to try other things - ambitious projects that I have had in mind for many years. Shall I have the strength, shall I live long enough?</p><p>Affectionately</p><p><em>B.B.</em></p>
