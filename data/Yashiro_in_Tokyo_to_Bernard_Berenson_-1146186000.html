Box Shitaya 14, Tokio]</p><p align="left">Tokio<br/>6 September, 1933</p><p align="left">Dear Mr. Berenson,</p><p align="left">Thank you so much for your letter, which gave me such a vivid recollection of my happy days at I Tatti many years ago. I saw in my mind’s eye that spacious library, where I used to work, that sunny dining room, where you kindly put me in touch with various interesting people, and where I had to divide my poor effort into the two most important problems, how to enjoy the good food served there &amp; yet how to talk or rather mumble in my bad English! And the daffodils, which used to burst into golden splendour in the garden each Spring, the hills of Settignano covered with olives, the distant view of Florence, etc. etc. I am made homesick for you &amp; for your villa.</p><p align="left">Your advice that I should devote myself to the historical study of Chinese Painting, came to me just at the right time. After my recent visit to Harvard, I have really realized the international necessity of an oriental scholar devoted to Chinese studies in a modern scientific manner, &amp;, if I may say so, I am suited for the task, after being educated in art-studies under your guidance, I will do that, and I do hope that from now on I may show you that results of my new efforts every now &amp; then.</p><p align="left">Of the two Chinese paintings in your collection, I confess, I have not seen them. At the time I was so devoted to my Italian studies that nothing else existed for me. That is perhaps the reason how I missed seeing them. Now I am dying to see them. <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Binyon-Laurence" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Binyon-Laurence">Binyon’s</a> article on one of the paintings, which appeared in the Dedalo, was sent to me by Binyon. But I have no photographs of the paintings. I beseech you to send me photographs of the two paintings, the Dancing scene and the Palace scenes. As yet I cannot say anything definite about the Dancing scene, but about the latter, judging from the faded photos published in the Museum Journal (Pennsylvania University Museum, December 1928), I am quite sure that it is one of the best Sung painting (after Tang style) in existence. I want to publish the Philadelphia fragment of the same picture in my journal Bijutsu- Kenkiu (Journal of Art Studies) and I badly need good photographs of your painting. May I ask you to send them at your earliest convenience? I shall long for their quick arrival. Please send me at the same time the photos of the other Chinese painting, the Dancing Scene.</p><p align="left">I am upset to hear that Mrs. Berenson is still ill. Please remember me to her &amp; tell her how I long to call on her. Enclosed I send her small photos of Mt. Fuji. I do hope that she and you would come to Tokio, if only to visit your old friends <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Grew-Joseph" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Grew-Joseph">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Grey [Grew]</a> -- and Yuki Yashiro! As for the book, which you have mentioned in your letter, on Syria &amp; Palestine, I am impatient to see it.</p><p align="left">With most affectionate regards,</p><p align="left"><em>Yuki Yashiro</em></p>
