You were with me from 1921 to 1924, not only learning from me but helping in my work. You have returned again and again and I look forward to seeing you yet again.</p><p>In the field of Italian art you have produced the most authoritative, the most illuminating and the most readable book on Botticelli in any language.</p><p>Botticelli’s swift flame-like yet modelling line is almost unique in European art but I have encountered it frequently in Japanese drawings. Indeed there is a great affinity between the draughtsmanship of Florentine and Japanese artists. Thanks to you, my dear Yashiro, we Europeans have come to have subtler and more penetrating appreciation of the achievement of your countrymen and they of ours.</p><p>May this version of Italian Painters help Japanese students to enjoy our artists as You have helped us to feel and understand Botticelli.</p><p>Ever affectionately,</p><p>Bernard Berenson</p>
