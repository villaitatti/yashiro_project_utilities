<p align="left">Oiso, June 27<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B., </p><p align="left">I think of you very much. So I write this letter. How are you? I hope you are well. Japan is now in the rainy season, the worst time in the year, and my health is very low. Since I got the Radiation treatment last February, although theoretically I have recovered from the exhaustion caused by it, I do not feel at all well. Moreover my chronic disease Hypertension has aggravated &amp; I have to remain very quiet &amp; inactive. Perhaps I have worked too much on my coming book “Masterpieces of Japanese Art.” The publisher Thames &amp; Hudson in London want the MSS as quickly as possible, which is still now an impossibility, because I am ill &amp; cannot work, so much as I could wish. But the whole work is about 3/4 over, Thank heaven!</p><p align="left">I am ashamed to say that Japanese Edition of “Italian Painters” is not out yet. After the last War our people became demoralized &amp; even my best pupils would not work, so much as I wish. This is perhaps because there are too many people in this narrow country &amp; life is so difficult. Moreover (just imagine!) some part (not very big part ) of the translated text was lost by a secretary of the publisher, &amp; one of the translators had to do the translation over again. All these are bad news for you, but now at last nearly translations are over, &amp; this autumn the book would be made. My long preface as the editor of this translation is being printed &amp; I have seen the printer’s proofs. Till now the situations about the book were so bad, that I had no courage to make a report of the translation-work to you. Now I heave a great sigh of relief, because my promise to you &amp; to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">B Horovitz</a> of Phaidon to supervise the Japanese edition of the “Bible” for the study of Italian Paintings, is about to be accomplished.</p><p align="left">About this time last year I was in Europe with my wife. What a great pity was it, that we could not call on you at Vallombrosa before our departure for Tokyo. I wish I could come to Italy to call on you &amp; to see your face, to clasp your hand &amp; to see I Tatti over again. My wife wants it too. But if my poor health continues like this, I am afraid, it would be difficult.</p><p align="left">If my health recovers, I want to go to U. S. over again to write on Chinese art. This again may be a dream.</p><p align="left">Wishing for your health with my whole heart,</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yuki</em> </p><p align="left">My wife sends her best love to you &amp; to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a>. My love to Nicky, too.</p>
