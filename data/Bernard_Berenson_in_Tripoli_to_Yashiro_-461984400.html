<p>My dear Yashiro, </p>
<p>I am glad to read in yours of May 5 that you are feeling better. Let me hope this will find you rimesso à nuovo. I hasten to urge you not to abandon the idea of writing a book on Oriental Art. I am confident that a publisher could easily be found, in America or in England, probably the Phaidon again.</p>
<p>I have come here for a change and rest in a climate, vegetation, and with inhabitants so different from Tuscany. Ancient ruined cities abound and I love to look and muse .</p>
<p>The English edition of my “Lorenzo Lotto” will appear soon I hope. The volume on the Venetian Painters, the first of the four constituting a catalogue of Itl. pictures from circa 13 to circa 1600 will be ready for the press before the end of the year.</p>
<p>My health is not too good. What can one expect at 90?</p>
<p>Affectionately,</p>
<p><em>B.B.</em></p>
