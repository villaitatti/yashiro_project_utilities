<p align="left">Oiso, Feb. 25.</p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">Since I received your last letter of Dec. 30, I have been so busy preparing for my trip to Europe that I could not write to you, nor to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">John Walker</a>Â about the plans of the books, which I intend to write in English on Far Eastern Arts.</p><p align="left">I am leaving Tokyo on March 3<sup>rd</sup> on SAS plane for Rome, where I shall arrive on March 5<sup>th</sup>. I do not know what program is waiting for me in Italy, so at present I cannot tell you exactly when I can call on you at I Tatti. Of course I want to call on you as quickly as possible but I think my visit would be probably in the early part of April. I will correspond with you from Rome. Of course when I call on you, I will take my wife Fumi with me. All these thirty years she has been hearing about you a great deal from me, &amp; now she is excited to have the first chance to get to know you the master of her husband directly. My wife is a quiet Japanese woman in Japanese clothes. I hope you would come to like her, just as you did me. She is also excited to meet <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a>, whose photo is in the album of my family, &amp; who has always been kind to me.</p><p align="left">This is just a short notice to tell you that our visit to you is very near and that we are looking forward to it with greatest anticipation.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
