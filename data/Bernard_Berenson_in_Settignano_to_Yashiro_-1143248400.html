<p class="Body">Oct. 10, 1933<br/>My dear Yashiro,</p><p class="Body">I have sent you two photos, one of the Palace Scenes that you admire so much and one of the other Chinese painting. I look forward to reading what you have to say about them altho’ you will scarcely venture at final conclusions until you have seen the originals.</p><p class="Body">I wish I could hope to get to Japan, but I am in my 69th year, I have more and more to do and my own field and my physical energies are already on the decline. No doubt there are people who will tell you my mental energies are in no better state. Be that as it may, I must husband what remains and use it to complete the tasks I have set myself. Then and only then, if I survive, with enough strength to travel, may I hope to get to Japan. You I still hope to see here and perhaps soon.</p><p class="Body">I shall send you some more articles in the course of the next few months. </p><p class="Body">Kindest remembrances from all of us.</p><p class="Body">Yours,</p><p class="Body"><em>B. Berenson</em></p>
