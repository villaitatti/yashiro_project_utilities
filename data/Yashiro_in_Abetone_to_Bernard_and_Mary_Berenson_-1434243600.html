<p align="left"><span>Abetone<br/></span><span>July 21 </span></p><p align="left">Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Berenson, </p><p align="left">I am afraid you are wondering by this time at my sudden disappearance &amp; my long silence. I have actually hidden myself among the Apeninnes &amp; devoted myself to my “Botticelli”. Now I finished it at last, &amp; I am going down to Florence, to prepare for my final departure from “la mia Firenze”. Before my departure I must see you even for a moment, to express my deep felt gratitude -- more than gratitude -- to you. What I learned of Italian Art &amp; have to go on with my further study, I owe to you entirely. Oh how I wish that I may continue my way by your side. You may understand my sadness to go away from the country where I feel really in my element &amp; from the work in which I really feel my own vocation, if I may say so, &amp; from the master, who has been the real guiding spirit of mine.</p><p align="left">I think, by this time you are in Vallombrosa. Can I ask you when I can come to you to say good-bye. I go down to Florence tomorrow &amp; immediately begin my preparations for a departure. I shall stay there perhaps till 29 or 30. The while I am quite free to come to you at any time you mention. I am waiting for your answer at Hotel Berchielli, Lungarno Acciaioli, Florence.</p><p align="left">I wonder if Mrs. Berenson is already back in Italy. I shall be awfully sorry if I cannot see her!</p><p align="left">With best wishes,</p><p align="left">From your faithful pupil,</p><p align="left"><em>Y. Yashiro</em></p>
