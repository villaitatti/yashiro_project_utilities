<p class="Body">Sept. 1, 1937,</p><p class="Body">Dear Yashiro,</p><p class="Body">I have written more than once in the last 18 months without eliciting a word in reply. And in more recent months your art periodical has ceased to reach me. </p><p class="Body">I trust this does not mean either that your attitude toward me, or that your own position at home, has undergone a change for the worse.</p><p class="Body">The new edition of my Florentine Drawings is already in the press. I am beginning to think of the friends to whom copies are to be sent. You naturally rank among them but I must know just how and where to address them so that they shall reach you with the<strong> </strong>least trouble to yourself. I was in the Aegean during the brief interval that <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Tucci-Giuseppe" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Tucci-Giuseppe">Tucci</a> was here, so that I failed to see him and get information about you from him.</p><p class="Body">Sincerely yours,</p><p class="Body"><em>B. Berenson</em></p>
