<p>Via Vincigliata, Florence, Dec. 28, 57</p>
<p>My dear Yashiro,</p>
<p>I have just heard from <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Dunham-Katherine" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Dunham-Katherine">Katherine Dunham</a>.</p>
<p>She writes that you are far from well, and that your dear wife is very anxious about your health.</p>
<p>I share her feelings, but I implore you not to give up hope. The <em>will</em> to live and get well can still perform miracles.</p>
<p>Two years ago the doctors gave me up and were so sure that I was dying that my bed-room was crowded with devoted friends and dependents to give me a last salute. I <em>would not die</em>. I insisted on living, and I am still alive altho’ now nearly 93 years old.</p>
<p><em>Live</em> and come here to do the new edition of your true and beautiful book on Botticelli.</p>
<p>With respectful greetings to your wife,</p>
<p>Affectionately yours,</p>
<p><em>B.B.</em></p>
