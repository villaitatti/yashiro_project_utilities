<p>A statement made during Yashiro’s stay in Villa I Tatti.</p>
<p>[written on the I Tatti letterhead] <br/>January 6<sup>th</sup> 1952<br/>To Mr. Bernard Berenson</p>
<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>I take in charge your fragment of the tiny copy of the scroll by Chou Wen-Chü reproduced as Pl. I &amp; II of No. 25, January, 1934 of the Bijutsu Kenkyu.</p>
<p>I shall see that when it gets to Japan it shall be properly restored &amp; eventually returned to you. I shall have it insured with a reliable American insurance company for Five Thousand Dollars, you paying for the same and for the expense of restoration with cheques on New York.</p>
<p>Hoping that this transaction will be satisfactory all around,</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
