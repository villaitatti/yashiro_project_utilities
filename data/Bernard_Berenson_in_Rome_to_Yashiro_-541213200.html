With the same post goes a cheque<strong> </strong>to the address you have given. It is very good news<strong> </strong>that you are going to have an exhibition of Japanese art in U.S.A. I wish I could be there to see it.</p><p class="Body">I am glad the restoration of the scroll has turned out so well,<strong> </strong>and been approved by all who have seen it. Among them was <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Wenley-Archibald" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Wenley-Archibald">Wenley</a> of the Freer Museum who wrote to tell me of his delight in seeing it. I have been enjoying Rome, and mean to do so another fortnight. Then I return to I Tatti to finish preparing the third<strong> </strong>edition of “Lorenzo Lotto.” It will contain more items than the previous ones. Otherwise not much changed.</p><p class="Body">Here nothing new has turned up, but I never tire of seeing what I have seen so many times in the last 60 years.</p><p class="Body">Let us hope that you and yours are as well happy as is possible in these tormenting times.</p><p class="Body">With love from Nicky and,</p><p class="Body"><em>B.B.</em></p>
