<p align="left">1017 Oiso<br/>Oct. 30<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">Dear B.B., </p><p align="left">All through summer I have been very busy with preparations for the coming Exhibition of Japanese Art in U.S.A., as three delegates from America came to Tokyo &amp; I had to take them round. By the way, this exhibition is on a very high artistic quality and will be held in Washington (National Gallery), New York, Boston, Chicago &amp; Seattle from January 1953 till autumn.</p><p align="left">Meanwhile the repairing of your Chinese Scroll was making progress &amp; I went to see it every now &amp; then. Now it is all over &amp; ready to be sent back to you through Italian Embassy here. At present the Italian Ambassador Marquis <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/D-Ajeta-Blasco" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/D-Ajeta-Blasco">D’Ajeta</a> is very busy with the recent arrival of the Italian trade mission to Tokyo, but as soon as I see him, I shall have the scroll sent back to you by diplomatic bag.</p><p align="left">Enclosed, I send you Statement of account for the whole expense (repairing &amp; insurance). Please [here several lines are missing]. The bill of Mayuyama &amp; Co., who did the whole work, I have paid myself (Japanese Yen 61,462.02), and I want its equivalent $170.72 to be paid to the above mentioned Mr. H. Nagatani of Chicago, to whom I owe some money in my last trip to U. S.</p><p align="left">Before the scroll was repaired, I had it photographed. After the repairing was finished, I compared the scroll with the photographs before the repairing &amp; I ascertained that the repairing is perfect.</p><p align="left">I showed the scroll to many Japanese experts &amp; they all admired it very very much. I wanted to have some part of it reproduced in colour, but as the repairing took so much time, and as I imagine you miss it badly, I send it back to you immediately. To reproduce it in colour takes much time.</p><p align="left">For the coming Exhibition of Japanese art in America, I am reluctant to go to U.S., although I am asked to do so, because I shall feel unsettled for another half a year &amp; I cannot do my own scholarly works. If I go there, of course, I shall be happy to meet my friends again, <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">John Walker</a>, <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Edgell-George" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Edgell-George">Edgell</a> etc.</p><p align="left">I hope you are well. I was told that last summer was very hot in Italy, and I am anxious whether you did not suffer from the heat too much.</p><p align="left">With all my love &amp; regard to BB and to Nicky,</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
