He hopes to thank you personally for it before long. – This is the photo of a little picture painted an English painter friend of ours and which I thought you and <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumi</a> would like to have a little souvenir. With much love to you both, also in B.B.’s name.</p><p align="left">Ever yours,</p><p align="left"><em>Nicky</em></p>
