<p>Yashiro's <em>Study of the Annunciation in Art</em> (1952), mentioned in this letter, was sent to Berenson with a handwritten dedication by the author. A sketch of Yashiro by <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/dario-neri" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/dario-neri">Dario Neri</a> was found in the book. The sketch was presumably made when Yashiro visited I Tatti in 1956; see below.<!--break--></p><p align="left">Oiso, Oct. 22<sup>nd</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">Thank you ever so much for sending me “Bibliografia”. That is a very convenient publication, which teaches us the wide range of your intellectual activities. That is especially valuable &amp; useful for me, as I am just writing my preface to the Japanese edition of “Italian Painters”, in which I plan to make clear to Japanese public what a great brain and a warm heart you have.</p><p align="left">Your secretary wrote to me in your absence that my book on the Annunciation in Art had arrived. I feel very shy to think that you would look through it. There may be many mistakes in the names &amp; attributed names of the illustrations, because here in Japan, reliable books on European Art are so scarce, &amp; it is almost impossible to verify the names. My main purpose in the book is to trace both psychologically &amp; pictorially the development of that interesting subject through historical periods. I think I had something new to say in that book, but as the text is in Japanese I cannot explain that to you. The only interest you might take in the book, would be the collection of many photos of the Annunciation in various countries &amp; of various periods.</p><p align="left"><a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Tucci-Giuseppe" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Tucci-Giuseppe">Dr. Tucci</a> of the Italian Institute for the Middle &amp; Far East is just here in Tokyo. He says kindly that he is going to invite me to Italy soon. So I may come to Italy sometime in near future. My heart warms, as I think I may call on you again.</p><p align="left">Hoping that you are well,</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p><p align="left">Please remember me to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a>!</p>
