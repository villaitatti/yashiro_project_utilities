<p align="left">Settignano, April 10. 53</p><p align="left">My dear Yashiro,Â </p><p align="left">The scroll is in my hands again. Never have I received anything so devotely [?] so carefully packed. We have unrolled it, and admired the excellence of the restoration, and how little of the quality of line has been sacrificed. I thank you with all my heart for this as well as for so many other marks of all but filial devotion. I am finishing the revision of Lorenzo Lotto. It will appear in Italian at first and perhaps last.</p><p align="left">I have plenty of work in mind, enough to keep me busy for years. But shall I have those years?</p><p align="left">I address this to Washington because you still may be in America. I have had the illustrated catalogue of the exhibition and many enthusiastic letters about it.</p><p align="left">Every good wish,</p><p align="left">Affectionately,</p><p><em>B.B.</em></p>
