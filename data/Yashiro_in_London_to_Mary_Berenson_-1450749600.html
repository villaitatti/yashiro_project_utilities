It is full of requests &amp; entreaties, as if her generosity were not already more than enough. Oh Since I went to you one morning, bright with Autumnal sunshine -- it was two &amp; half years ago -- you were giving me such a quantity of kindness. Oh that there may be some chance in future when I can repay you even a particle of it!</p><p><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
