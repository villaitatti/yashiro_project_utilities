<p>I Tatti<br/>Settignano<br/>Florence</p><p>November 21, 1955</p><p>My dear Yashiro,</p><p>I have looked through your book on the Annunciation with great interest and even found a few illustrations of originals unknown to me, yet I cannot say that I know what you are driving at. I hope you will be coming here soon and a voce you will explain your intentions to me.</p><p>I regret to tell you that there has been a great upset in the Washington National Gallery and the Kress Foundation. <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">Walker</a> is leaving and is in a state of great agitation and perplexity. I have not dared to approach him recently on any subject except his own troubles, but I hope to be able very soon to do so. I mean to ask him to try to procure for you an income of at least $2500 a year for five years. I should expect you to spend these years in preparing a work on the art of the Extreme Orient. I have not the slightest doubt that the Phaidon or other presses would be ready to publish it.</p><p>The death of <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">Horovitz</a> has been a great blow to all our interests. There is nobody in the firm to take his place, nobody who has his vision, nobody to oppose the over-Germanic influence that prevails there. Apparently the present head is <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Goldscheider-Ludwig" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Goldscheider-Ludwig">Dr. Goldscheider</a> and I expect him here very soon. I shall do my best to advise and encourage him.</p><p>Nothing more for today.</p><p>Affectionately yours,</p><p><em>B.B.</em></p>
