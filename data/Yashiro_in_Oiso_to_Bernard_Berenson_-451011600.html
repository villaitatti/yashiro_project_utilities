<p align="left">Oiso, Sept. 17<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">I read your letter from Vallombrosa, written on Sept. 10<sup>th</sup> with great enthusiasm &amp; with my heart full of gratitude to you. You told me how you spoke of me &amp; of my wishes with <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">John Walker</a><a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">.</a> I really feel almost guilty to trouble my old master with my own affair &amp; take his precious time and energy! Please pardon me! But I have my full confidence in what I would do &amp; what I can do, if I come over to the wish for some years by your help. I would never betray your expectations.</p><p align="left">Studies of Oriental Art still remain on a stage, something like that of Italian Painting, before <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Morelli-Giovanni" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Morelli-Giovanni">Morelli</a> appeared and before my master BB. purged it with new analysis and criticism. Oriental Art is, moreover, on a condition much worse, because of the difficulty of Oriental languages. While I was studying Italian Painting with you, without noticing it, I learned the method with which you have built up your wonderful work on Italian Painting. When I turned my attention to Oriental Art, I felt that my mission is to apply this method to the study of Oriental Art &amp; build up a history of Oriental Art with a new attitude. You may think that my ambition is too big, and maybe I am a bit too old to accomplish it, as it should be. But I want to devote my remaining years for it and I think I can at least open a new approach to Oriental Art.</p><p align="left">Please don’t doubt that my major work is to write books on Oriental Art. There is no danger for me to go astray.</p><p align="left">When I used to meet the late <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">Mr. Horovitz</a> of Phaidon Press, he repeatedly asked me to write a book on “Story of Oriental Art”, and I assured him I shall write it one day. I wonder if my talks with him are transmitted to his successors at the Phaidon Press.</p><p align="left">While I was in U. S. three years ago with the Japanese Exhibition, John Walker was very very kind to me. I wish that my dream of going to the West be realized by your help. </p><p align="left">Yours ever faithful pupil,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p><p align="left">P.S.  <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Coolidge-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Coolidge-John">John Coolidge</a> wrote from your villino &amp; told me how you are faring well. That is a very good news to me. Also I read in the Atlantic Monthly <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Taylor-Francis" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Taylor-Francis">Francis Henry Taylor’s </a>article on you, which also delighted me. I long to call on you at I Tatti once again and before long.</p><p align="left">P.S.  Please remember me to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a>. I repeat in my memory the many happy days, which I spent at I Tatti. At that time, that is to say, in 1922 and thereabout, we were all quite young!</p>
