<p>Letter sent together with the scroll.</p>

<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>The repairing &amp; remounting of this precious scroll was finally finished &amp; I feel greatly relieved to send it back to you. The work was done by best artists in Tokyo under my direct supervision, and the result was perfect so far as I could judge.</p>
<p>On the box I made two inscriptions; the one on the surface of the lid is the title of the scroll and the other on the back explains how I had it repaired in Tokyo in August 1952 at the request of my dear old teacher and master Mr. Bernard Berenson.</p>
<p>Your old pupil,</p>
<p><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
