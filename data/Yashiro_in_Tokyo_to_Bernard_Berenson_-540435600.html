The work was done by best artists in Tokyo under my direct supervision, and the result was perfect so far as I could judge.</p><p align="left">On the box I made two inscriptions; the one on the surface of the lid is the title of the scroll and the other on the back explains how I had it repaired in Tokyo in August 1952 at the request of my dear old teacher and master Mr. Bernard Berenson.</p><p align="left">Your old pupil,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
