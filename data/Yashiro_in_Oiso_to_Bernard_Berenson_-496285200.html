<p align="left">1017 Oiso, Giappone<br/>April 11<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">Coming back from a trip, I found the parcel on my desk, which contained 14 photos of you &amp; of I Tatti, and BB’s short biography &amp; also BB’s principal publications, all of which are very necessary for me in order to write an article on BB’s Italian studies as a sort of preface to the Japanese Edition of “Italian Painters”. Some of the photographs were so good that they brought tears to my eyes. What I like best of all BB’s pictures is that one in which BB reclines on a sofa at his ease in front of Domenico Veneziano. Thank you very much for sending all those materials immediately. Now I can begin to write the Preface. The translation work is going on very well by my best pupils.</p><p align="left">To-day is April 11<sup>th</sup>. Japan is in her best glory in spring. Italy must be so too! How I want to call on you again in I Tatti, where, besides the joy of saluting my old teacher again, I can indulge in my own recollection of young days. I think I told you that since I came back from U.S. just about a year ago, I began to suffer from “high blood pressure” which is preventing me from moving about very much. By this time I ought to be in Paris and in Holland to attend meetings of Unesco, but my bad health prevented me from going. I am just being invited by <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Tucci-Giuseppe" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Tucci-Giuseppe">Tucci</a> to come over to Venice to give some lectures at the time of Marco Polo’s festival. This time perhaps I may go, but I have not decided yet. If I go at all, of course I will come to I Tatti to greet my old teacher again. Please remember me to Nicky.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
