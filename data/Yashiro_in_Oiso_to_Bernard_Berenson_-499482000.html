<p align="left">1017 Oiso, Japan<br/>5<sup>th</sup> March, 54.</p><p align="left">Dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">This is an exceptionally cold winter. As I suffer from high blood pressure since my return from U.S.A. in May last year, this cold winter is not good for me. I am leading as quiet life as possible in this country-side. How are you getting on? I think of you very often, although I cannot write so often as I wish. To write in English is an effort for my enfeebled body, &amp; in my family, there is no one who can write letters in English in my stead.</p><p align="left">How are you? I do hope that you are well and healthy! About the Japanese edition of your Italian Painters, all preparations are over! You may have heard from <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Horowitz-Bela">Horovitz</a> already. I have got four best translators in Japan. I could not let <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu">Miwa</a> participate in the work, because we intend to begin translation soon &amp; Miwa is not here. I am going to supervise the whole work &amp; moreover I will write a long preface to the book, in which I want to explain to the Japanese public the importance of BB for Italian studies. In Japan Italian studies have been so little done that even such an [sic] self-evident fact as BB’s importance for such studies has to be well explained. Please ask <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a> to write to me a short outline of BB’s life and also to send me a list of books published by BB. Although I know them in a general way, I must make my knowledge of BB’s life and BB’s bibliography exact, so that I do not make any mistake in my Preface.</p><p align="left">Also please send me a photograph of yours. Your photograph which you gave me in 1924, when I left Florence after my first stay, I still have it always on my desk. But it is a little too old to be used in the coming Japanese Edition. So please send me a recent photo of yours.</p><p align="left">And also please send me photos of I Tatti, its beautiful outside with gardens &amp; trees, &amp; its interior with library &amp; collections. I want to use them possibly as illustrations for my preface &amp; also eventually for some articles on BB, which I shall write at the time, when Japanese edition comes out. (As there is no more space on this letter paper I stop short.) My love to you and also to Nicky.</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
