<p align="left">Oiso, March 3<sup>rd</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">The coldest season is gone &amp; now Japan is lovely with Spring flower going to bloom.</p><p align="left">How are you getting on? I think of you &amp; of <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a> &amp; of I Tatti very much. My wife <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumi</a> does the same.</p><p align="left">As for me, I ought to be in U.S.A. (at Stanford University, where I am being invited as Consultant Professor) by this time. But just before my departure from Tokyo on Jan. 29<sup>th</sup>, something strange was found in my lung by X-ray photo, which might possibly be an incipient cancer. I was taken to Cancer-research Institute Hospital in Tokyo, where I have been treated with Ray Cobalt 60 for about a month. I was released from the hospital just a few days ago. Now they say that strange thing in my lung is not so malicious a thing as cancer, but at any rate it must still be treated with Ray for sometime yet. The treatment with Ray is so exhausting that I cannot do anything now. But thank heaven, it is not painful!</p><p align="left">This is short note to you to explain why I have been silent to you so long. I am very glad to tell you that my illness was found so early that it can be cured.</p><p align="left">I hope you are keeping well. I must come again to I Tatti &amp; salute you personally.</p><p align="left">My wife &amp; my son &amp; myself are always talking about you &amp; about I Tatti.</p><p align="left">Please remember me to Nicky.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
