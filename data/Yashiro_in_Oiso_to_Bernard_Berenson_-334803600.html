<p>Oiso, May 24</p>
<p>My dear BB,</p>
<p>Myself &amp; my wife <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumi</a> are very anxious about your health! How are you?</p>
<p>I have recovered from my illness, and I plan to come to call on you at I Tatti with wife this autumn. Perhaps in the beginning of November. Please keep strong &amp; wait for the visit of Yuki &amp; his wife Fumi.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I am again invited by Stanford University, California to visit there as consulting professor of Eastern Arts. Taking this opportunity of going out of my country (which is otherwise very difficult), I will go round the world, so that I may call on you at Florence on my way back to Japan in autumn. I shall leave Japan June 15<sup>th</sup> &amp; stay in U. S. (Stanford &amp; elsewhere) for about 5 months &amp; in the beginning of November I shall arrive in Italy. My stay in Rome would be only for a week or ten days, during which I shall call on you at I Tatti or Vallombrosa or wherever you may be. My wife feels excited to meet you again.</p>
<p>Your letter telling me “not to lose hope” &amp; that “the will to live still sometimes performs miracles”, which really resuscitated me, when I felt very weak two years ago, forces me to give back those precious words to you!</p>
<p>The new “Accademia Giapponese” is going to be established in Rome &amp; I may be appointed its first director, if I am willing. The new building will begin before summer, and it would be finished next year. My dear Master BB, please live &amp; wait for your old pupil, who will come to join you in Italy in a future not very far!</p>
<p>How is our dear <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a>? Please ask her to drop me &amp; my wife even a short note to tell us how you are faring.</p>
<p>As I make haste to post this letter, I stop short, &amp; merely send to you our warmest love &amp; most sincere wishes</p>
<p><em>Yuki Yashiro</em></p>
<p><em>Fumi Yashiro</em></p>
