<p>Dear B.B.,</p>
<p>I take the liberty to introduce the bearer of this letter <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Imaizumi-Atsuo" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Imaizumi-Atsuo">Mr. Atsuo Imaizumi</a>, a well-recognized art-critic of modern art in Japan, a sort of pupil of mine, who is visiting Italy. At the same time He is an intimate friend &amp; colleague of <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Miwa-Fukumatsu">Miwa</a>, who is translating your book into Japanese. If you can meet him &amp; give him a chance to see your collection &amp; library, I shall appreciate it as a great education to Mr. Imaizumi.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
<p>P. S.Â  I arrived in Paris last night. I shall write you soon.</p>
