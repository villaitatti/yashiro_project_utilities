<p>I should be so pleased to hear from you and learn that all was well with you. We are in fair condition given our advanced years, hard at work. I have been writing about theory in our studies and had pleasure in quoting you. I fear it will be a long time before I publish anything again.Â </p>
<p>All good wishes,</p>
