<p align="left">Sept. 13<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">Thank you very much for your letter of Aug. 19<sup>th</sup>, which was from Vallombrosa. Since July I have been ailing in a hospital in Tokyo. I think I worked too much, which told on my nerves, which had been enfeebled by the Radiation treatment, which I had last February. I suffer from sleeplessness &amp; other nervous disorders. But fortunately now I feel stronger &amp; better &amp; I think I can get away from the hospital in a future not very very far.</p><p align="left">I am much worried by your weakened health, &amp; I pray to heaven that I may have another chance to come over to Italy &amp; to call on you at I Tatti again. My wife <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumi</a> also says so. Please become stronger, so that we can meet again!</p><p align="left">It is very nice of <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">John Walker</a> to think of me &amp; to talk of me with you. If I come at all to Stanford University, California, I shall surely come to Washington to meet him. But for the moment I do not know whether I am strong enough to go to Stanford.</p><p align="left">You say <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Maraini-Fosco" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Maraini-Fosco">Fosco Maraini’s</a> book on Japan is magnificent. It must be so, judging from what he did on Tibet. But I have not seen the book yet.</p><p align="left">I want to write longer, but I am still too weak. This is just to show you that I have recovered enough to write a letter in English. From now on I shall write to you every now &amp; then.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em> Yuki</em></p><p align="left">At long last the Japanese edition of Italian Painters would be out in November!</p><p align="left">My love to Nicky!</p>
