<p align="left">no. 1017, Oiso, Japan<br/>June 2<sup>nd</sup></p><p align="left">Dear B.B., </p><p align="left">While I was contemplating to write to you, and yet postponing it day by day, as I am terribly busy after my absence from Japan for five months, your letter of May 27<sup>th</sup> arrived. With a guilty feeling, I take up my pen &amp; report to you immediately, what I ought to have done long before.</p><p align="left">Your precious Chinese scroll had arrived here safely &amp; been kept by <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/D-Ajeta-Blasco" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/D-Ajeta-Blasco">Ambassador D’Ajeta</a> with great care till my return. Then I transported it to the safe of this Institute of Art Research, Tokyo, (where I had been Director for twenty years, &amp; after a short interval, has been appointed Director again just a month ago: of this I shall tell you sometime later). To-day I hasten to tell you about your scroll. As you requested me I had it insured as follows: ― </p><p align="left">○value: U. S. $5,000. ―</p><p align="left">○Insurance Company: American International Underwriters’ Corporation, representing Pacific National Fire Insurance Company (home office, San Francisco, which is doing wide business in Japan &amp; highly appreciated by American businessmen in Tokyo).</p><p align="left">○For Fire, Burglary and theft.</p><p align="left">○For three months (May 9--Aug. 9, 1952)</p><p align="left">○Premium for the above: $53.35</p><p align="left">The insurance for the transport back from Tokyo to Rome by Air would cost $ 25.00, but for this I have not done yet, because if the scroll be send back to Italy by the diplomatic bag by Ambassador <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/D-Ajeta-Blasco" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/D-Ajeta-Blasco">D’Ajeta</a> to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto">Auriti </a>of the Foreign Office in Rome, it would be difficult to insure. For this I shall study &amp; talk with D’Ajeta, when the repairing &amp; remounting be finished.</p><p align="left">About the repairing &amp; remounting, I have asked the best repairer in Japan to do it, and they began to do the work. Of course, I will supervise it as best I can. You need not be uneasy about it. When the scroll is remounted, the scroll would become a little thicker -- it is difficult to explain this technical matter in this letter, but please trust me that I will do the best possible way for the preservation of the scroll for the future. The cost for the repairing is not estimated yet. I think it is rather expensive, but I shall take care to make it entirely reasonable.</p><p align="left">About the payment of the premium to be paid to the Insurance Company (American International Underwriter’s Corporation), that is, $53.35, mentioned above, I shall pay it now here in Tokyo in Japanese money. In what way I shall ask you to pay that back to me, I shall write to you later. Perhaps I shall ask you to pay that to the dollar fund, which I have in U.S.A. As my son is staying in Paris for the study of music, I am sending my money to him. It is terribly difficult to buy dollars in Japan. That is the reason, why I have left the remnant of my dollars in America, from which I am sending monthly expenses for my son.</p><p align="left">This letter is all for the immediate business. When I have more time, I shall write to you what I did in America, how I met <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">John Walker</a>, <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Frankfurter-Alfred" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Frankfurter-Alfred">Frankfurter</a>, &amp; <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Wildenstein-Georges" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Wildenstein-Georges">Wildenstein</a>, to whom you gave me letters of introductions, &amp; who treated me so kindly, while I was staying in New York &amp; Washington.</p><p align="left">It pleases me very much to hear that you are bringing out your old famous works on Italian Painters with 400 illustrations. I am anxious to have them. Of Lorenzo Lotto, as I had very little time at Berkeley, I did not know the existence of Lotto’s work there. So I regret to say that I cannot say anything about it. Of Lorenzo Lotto, I have your old edition, but I shall love to have its new edition. Please excuse me for this scribble.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>YUKI</em></p><p align="left">P. S. Please remember me to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky</a>. I am repeating in my memory those happy days at I Tatti this January.</p>
