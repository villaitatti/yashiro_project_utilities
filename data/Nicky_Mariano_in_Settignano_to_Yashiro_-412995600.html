Unfortunately B.B. was in bed with a bad cold but I took him to his room and they had a pleasant talk about Prof. Masui’s translation of the Florentine Painters into Japanese and about his own work on Italian Renaissance art. I also showed him the collection, the library and the garden and we had lunch together.</p><p align="left">I dare say he will be back in Japan before this reaches you and brings you and <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/fumi-yashiro">Fumi</a> and your son very affectionate messages from B.B. and from </p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Nicky</em></p>
