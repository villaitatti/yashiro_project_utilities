<p class="Body">Addr[e]ss: Settignano, Florence, Italy</p><p class="Body">Vallombrosa, Aug. 15, 1948</p><p class="Body">My very dear Yashiro,</p><p class="Body">It made me happy to receive your letter of May 9. I had been unhappy that my friend Miss Robinson of the<strong> </strong>American Red Cross had failed to get in touch with you and <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto">Auriti</a> kept saying you were dead. I felt sure you were not, but did not know how to get in touch with you; for after Miss R’s failure I tried again and again without success. At last, thanks to Gerard came your letter, and I wrote at once to <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Coster-Henry" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Coster-Henry">Mr. Coster</a> whether through Mr. Gerard I could correspond with you. I got a negative answer and then cast a post-card into space hoping it might reach you. At least thanks to the Italian foreign office I am writing at length, and I hope you can answer me through the same channel. At the same time I am sending you my last book which has appeared in Italian before its publication in English, in New York. If you want an English version I shall try to send it to you.</p><p class="Body">Let me tell you how glad I am to learn that at least you all are safe and sound, including, I hope, your gifted musician son. Your difficulties do not surprise me. I imagined them all, I am indeed pleased that it was no worse. Nationalism is a poisonous religion. It does not inculcate the love of ones’ own  but hatred of other peoples. </p><p class="Body">You do not exaggerate your services in the cause of Far Eastern Art. I never mention your name, and I do so often, without speaking of them. I only wish I could read all you have written. I fully sympathize with the distaste you have for your own people after their behavior in the last ten years and more; I<strong> </strong>should be happy to enable you to get a post in an American institution<strong> </strong>where you and your family could live while you went on with your work. I will do all I can, but it is little for I am not in touch with any university in U.S.A except Harvard, and that seems deaf to every proposal of mine. You have no idea<strong> </strong>probably in what a state of anti- art<strong> </strong>all-so called art now<strong> </strong>is in the Western World. But, be assured that I will do my best. Would you be allowed to go to U.S.A and could you take your family as well?</p><p class="Body">About myself, June 26 last I was 83 years old, and I feel it in every nerve and muscle. I have to waste much time resting, dozing, or reading periodicals. Yet I still try to write altho’ I feel no confidence in what I conclude. Beside the “Etica, Estetica e Storia<strong>” </strong>that I am sending you now, I have written a “Sketch for a Self-Portrait” and a war diary. I hope they will be published in time, altho’ it is very difficult to get anything that I write printed. There is little demand for what I can write.</p><p class="Body">My house and grounds suffered quite a little from the war, but are the same again as you knew it.  Only my wife is there no more. She died March 23, 1945. <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/people/nicky-mariano">Nicky Mariano</a> is still with me. She is my guardian angel. I could not live without her. We often talk of you and she sends you her love. I have made your friend <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Auriti-Giacinto">Auriti’s</a> acquaintance after we had corresponded for some time about you, last autumn. I saw him in Rome, his collections and his library. He has written a book on Japan, and sent me the manuscript to read. I have not done so yet. My works of art and library are pretty nearly unharmed. Some pictures of second quality were damaged but nearly all are repaired. </p><p class="Body">I have little to complain of, given my age. I still enjoy art and nature and friends. What more can one expect!</p><p class="Body">Yours affectionately,</p><p><em>Bernard Berenson </em></p>
