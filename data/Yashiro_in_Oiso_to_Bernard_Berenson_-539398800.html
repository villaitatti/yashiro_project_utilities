<p align="left">1017 Oiso<br/>November 28<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">Dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">Thank you very much for your letter, telling me that you have sent the cheque to the address in U.S., Mr. Nagatani in Chicago. Almost at the same time I have got a letter from this Nagatani, in which he told me the receipt of your cheque.</p><p align="left">As for your scroll, it was all finished &amp; is already to be sent to you through Italian Embassy. Then just before its departure, I showed the scroll to the staff of the Art Research Institute, where I am now the honorary Director, and they all admired the scroll so much that they wanted to have a part of the scroll reproduced in colour for their famous periodical “Bijutsu Kenkiu” (Journal of Art-Studies), which by the way you have in your library. As you allowed me to use your scroll, while it remains in Japan, for any scholarly or art-studying purposes, as I think fit, I took the liberty to keep the scroll in Tokyo for another ten days, so that the Art-Research Institute can take its photograph in colour. I intend to send off the scroll from Tokyo in about ten days through Italian Embassy. I hasten to tell you the reason of some delay of its arrival at I Tatti.</p><p align="left">Please remember me to Nicky.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,</p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p>
