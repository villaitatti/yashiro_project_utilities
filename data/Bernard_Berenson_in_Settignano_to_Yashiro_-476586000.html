<p align="left">Settignano, Florence, Nov. 25. 54</p><p align="left">My dear Yashiro, </p><p align="left">I have just read the review of the following book: <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Egami-Namio" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Egami-Namio">Namio Egami</a> Die alte Zivilisation Nordeurasiens, Kyoto, 1948.</p><p align="left">Do you know this book? If not will you look it up and if the illustrations are fairly copious, will you send it to me, and I shall repay you with a dollar check.</p><p align="left">I still browse in many fields although my strength is continuously diminishing.</p><p align="left">I am working at a new catalogue of all the Italian paintings, 13- to 1600 known to me. Each volume will have 800 illustrations, and that will be four volumes. The first is on the Venetians.</p><p align="left">Are there any in Japan?</p><p align="left">I hope all is well with you and yours, and that you are working and living as satisfactorily as circumstance permits. </p><p align="left">Affectionately,</p><p align="left"><em>B.B.</em></p>
