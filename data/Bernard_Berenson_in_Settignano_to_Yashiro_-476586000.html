<p>Settignano, Florence, Nov. 25. 54</p>
<p>My dear Yashiro, </p>
<p>I have just read the review of the following book: <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Egami-Namio" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Egami-Namio">Namio Egami</a> Die alte Zivilisation Nordeurasiens, Kyoto, 1948.</p>
<p>Do you know this book? If not will you look it up and if the illustrations are fairly copious, will you send it to me, and I shall repay you with a dollar check.</p>
<p>I still browse in many fields although my strength is continuously diminishing.</p>
<p>I am working at a new catalogue of all the Italian paintings, 13- to 1600 known to me. Each volume will have 800 illustrations, and that will be four volumes. The first is on the Venetians.</p>
<p>Are there any in Japan?</p>
<p>I hope all is well with you and yours, and that you are working and living as satisfactorily as circumstance permits. </p>
<p>Affectionately,</p>
<p><em>B.B.</em></p>
