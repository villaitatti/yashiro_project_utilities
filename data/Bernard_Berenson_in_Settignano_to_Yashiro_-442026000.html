<p>Settignano. Dec. 30. 55</p>
<p>Dear Yashiro,</p>
<p>Let me quote what <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Walker-John">Walker</a> writes me about your work on Far Eastern Art. <br/><br/>“If Yashiro will send me the outline of his work, and his own biographical data, I shall go to work with the Bollinger Foundation.”</p>
<p>I hope this will be forwarded if you already have left for Italy.</p>
<p>With my good wish for 1956.</p>
<p>Affectionately,</p>
<p><em>B.B.</em></p>
