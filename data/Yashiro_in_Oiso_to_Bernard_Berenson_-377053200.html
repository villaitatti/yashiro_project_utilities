<p align="left">Jan. 20<sup>th</sup></p><p align="left">My dear B.B.,</p><p align="left">There is no word from anybody, which gave me a greater strength, than your letter of <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/letter-108" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/letter-108">Dec. 28<sup>t</sup><sup>h</sup></a>, which you wrote immediately after receiving <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Dunham-Katherine" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Dunham-Katherine">Katherine Dunham's</a> report about my health. When I received your letter I was ailing in a hospital &amp; was feeling very much weakened. Your words, “but I implore you not to give up hope. The will to live and get well can still perform miracles” went deep into my soul &amp; I will insist on living, as you have done. That letter of yours has become a really guiding spirit for me, &amp; I am always carrying that letter in my inside pocket! Thank you, thank you, my old master! It was really a timely advice for me. My wife joins me to send our deep-felt gratitude to you.</p><p align="left">Just now I came out of the hospital, where I got an emergency operation, which was already healed. But I am not completely well yet. This is just to send my deep feeling for you, after I received that precious letter.</p><p align="left">Yours ever,  </p><p align="left"><em>Yukio Yashiro</em></p><p align="left">P.S. As you kindly tells me in your letter, when I recover in health, I will surely come over to I Tatti in order to prepare for the new edition of Botticelli. The prospect of visiting I Tatti over again &amp; work there, with my old master again giving me advices, gives me such a brightness for my future. I shall live my young days over again in the same old familiar place. I will try to live longer but at the same time, my dear teacher, you must live longer, so that you may let me join you &amp; do the work!</p><p align="left">Please remember us to Nicky.</p>
