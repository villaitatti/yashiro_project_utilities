I hasten to assure you that you enjoy my complete confidence. I understand fully all the economic difficulties in the way of bringing out a Japanese version of my Italian Painters. And no less the perhaps insurmountable difficulties in making an adequate translation of such a work.

Nowhere else do Greek and Byzantine, Arabic and French, Italian and Spanish meet harmoniously as they do here, and I am especially interested in the meeting and blending of different civilizations.</p><p align="left">“Lotto” is at the printer, (in Italian) and will be ready in Sept. and I look forward to sending you a copy.</p><p align="left">Every good wish from Nicky as well as,</p><p align="left"><em>B.B.</em></p>
