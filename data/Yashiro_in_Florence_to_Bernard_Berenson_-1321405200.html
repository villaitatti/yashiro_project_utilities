<p align="left">[letterhead: Cevenini’s Hotel Berchielli/ Lung’Arno Acciaioli – Florence]<br/>17 Feb.</p><p align="left">Dear Mr. B. Berenson,</p><p align="left">I came to Florence at last a few days ago, after wandering about these two months in Germany &amp; Austria since I met you in the Louvre. I wanted to come to I Tatti but I was told that Mrs. Berenson was not well. The day before yesterday I went out to take lunch with <a data-url="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Clark-Kenneth" href="http://yashiro.itatti.harvard.edu/Clark-Kenneth">Mr. Clark</a> &amp; I meant to come round to I Tatti to salute you if only for a moment. But when I learned from Mrs. Clark that in the very same afternoon Mrs. Berenson was leaving for Switzerland, I was afraid to disturb you when you were so busy, &amp; I gave up the desire of visiting you on that day. I merely looked at the yellow house of I Tatti from the window of Mr. Clark’s house &amp; thought of the many pleasant afternoons I passed there several years ago.</p><p align="left">Yesterday I went to Siena &amp; to-morrow I am leaving for Roma. When I come back from Rome in about a week, I will let you know, and if at that time you are free to see me, let me come to you. I want to greet you very much, before I leave for Japan.</p><p align="left">Yours,</p><p align="left"><em>Yuki Yashiro</em></p><p align="left">P. S. Please remember me to Miss Mariano.</p>
